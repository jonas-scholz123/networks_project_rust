# networks project rust
This is a repetition of my Network's project (which I wrote in C++) but this time written in Rust. It implements a growing network with unform probability distribution as well as a growing network with a probability kernel proportional to the number of neighbours each vertex has (k).


## To run:

```
cargo run --release
```
